# IceCream
Copied team project. 
My main role was the contact section, slider gallery and helping teammates.

The webpage has a clean and modern design. Bright images of appetizing ice cream are laid on top of a neutral white background. The header features a logo with the business name and a navigation menu that links to different sections of the page.

Scrolling down the page, users can see images and descriptions of each ice cream flavor, along with their prices. There is also a section that highlights the special offers and discounts available to customers.

The webpage is responsive, meaning that it adapts to different screen sizes and devices. It  have been created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Overall, the website provides a simple and effective way for potential customers to learn about the ice cream flavors offered  and make a decision about which flavor they would like to try.
